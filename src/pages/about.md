Hi! My name is [Alan Hylands](https://alanhylands.com) and this is **Analysts Assemble**. 

I share some of my wisdom and learnings from my 20+ years working as a data analyst across industries like e-commerce, healthcare, banking, and tech.

I also interview data professionals of all specialities and ask them to share their tips, tricks and career stories to help us all become a little bit better each day.

And, more importantly, how to use those skills to help our businesses and organisations use data to make better decisions.

### Where you can find me.

You can contact me by email (alan AT alanhylands DOT com) _or_ on this [contact form](https://alanhylands.com/contact/) _or_ take a chance on social media where I (very) occasionally post on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/alanhylands.com) or [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/alanhylands).
