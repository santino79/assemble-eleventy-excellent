Hi! My name is [Alan Hylands](https://alanhylands.com) and this is Analysts Assemble. 

I share some of my wisdom and learnings from my 20+ years working as a data analyst across industries like e-commerce, healthcare, banking, and tech.

I also interview data professionals of all specialities and ask them to share their tips, tricks and career stories to help us all become a little bit better each day.

And, more importantly, how to use those skills to help our businesses and organisations use data to make better decisions.
