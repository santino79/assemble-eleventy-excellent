My tune hasn't changed over the years on just how important SQL is as a game-changer for careers in data. In fact, I believe it is **THE** most fundamental skill you must have to get started as a data analyst.

I don't want anyone to be scared off from learning SQL by long, boring, complicated courses. So I've put together a [free SQL crash course](https://sqlcrashcourse.com) to try and keep folks in the SQL game.

### What does it cover?

It's (currently) 35 bite-sized lessons plus interactive quiz questions and covers all of the SQL basics to get people up and running and querying database tables. From basic SELECT queries to JOINs, CASE statements, dealing with NULL values and more.

### Who is this FREE SQL Crash Course for?

- You don't have any SQL experience. All you're getting is tumbleweed when you apply for data jobs that ask for SQL knowledge. It's starting to look like you'll never get your foot in the door.

- You've been working with data and spreadsheets for years in your current job. Excel was your gateway drug. A macro here, a formula there. But no-one takes you seriously when you want to make the move into an actual BI analyst role.

- You've taken Data Analytics classes in college and filled your resume with buzzwords aplenty. Spark, Hadoop, Python, R. But hiring managers won't even consider you for entry level data analyst jobs. They see your face drop into a sad frown when they mention your lack of SQL knowledge.

- You hear recruiters say "every analyst should know the basics of SQL" but you don't even know where to begin.

### What do you need to know?

You don't need any experience of SQL or coding for this course. We take it slowly and build the solid groundwork you'll need to get up to speed with SQL. Then you can practice at your own pace with some interactive quizzes with real data and hands-on SQL code.
