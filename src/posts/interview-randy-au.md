_This **Analysts Assemble** interview is with self-confessed data nerd **Randy Au**, a Quantitative UX Researcher at Google Cloud._

_Randy&#8217;s career has taken him through several big names in the tech world but it was his article in [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com), called [Succeeding As A Data Scientist At Small Companies / Startups](https://towardsdatascience.com/succeeding-as-a-data-scientist-in-small-companies-startups-92f59e22bd8c), that got my attention._

_As a fellow [data generalist](/articles/generalists-are-the-real-data-science-unicorns/), I wanted to dig a little deeper into Randy&#8217;s backstory and see what his path to bringing those general data science skills to Google was like._

### Tell us a bit about yourself, how did you get into the data space and what does your data journey look like so far?

**It&#8217;s a weird path.** Undergrad majors were Business Administration and Philosophy and I minored in some applied Math. MS was in Communications (the social science) where I did some computational linguistics and learned a bunch about social science methodology and philosophy of science. After that, I did a stint at an office design firm analyzing survey data and automating reports, a very brief stint in an ad-tech firm, then almost 6 years at [Meetup][2] the social network (analyst), 2 years at [Bitly][3] the link shortener (analyst), 1 year at [Primary][4] a kid&#8217;s clothing manufacturer/e-commerce as data engineer, before winding up in [Google Cloud][5] as a Quantitative UX Researcher.

About the only common thread through all this was I work as an internal support consultant. I didn&#8217;t make data products that users directly interacted with, so I was more of a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221; essentially. I make teams better =). All through the time, I&#8217;ve worked with every single team that existed, from engineering and product development to customer service to legal and finance. Math and data and programming is useful everywhere.

These days I use the exact same data science skills I have, and apply it to understanding users as a UXR. I still deal with cross functional teams, tons of separate systems up and down the tech stack, and lots of interesting data questions.

### What’s a typical day look like for you in your current data role? (Which tools and languages do you use? Big team/small team/lone wolf? Office-based or remote?)

Typical day is still chaotic as usual =) There&#8217;s often 3-5 projects/tasks running in parallel, lots of meetings to help set metrics, get alignment, report results. There&#8217;s a team of 7 other qualitative researchers, and I&#8217;m the only quant in the local group, so it&#8217;s a lot of the &#8220;building data-driven culture&#8221; type stuff across a ton of product teams.

I&#8217;m also in a rather unique position of supporting 8 semi-related products, so a lot of prioritization discussions have to happen.

Day-to-day I&#8217;ll be using Python and various dialects of SQL, occasionally some spreadsheet magic thrown in.

### You&#8217;ve built up a large following through your blogging. How important do you think it is for data professionals, at all stages of their career, to share publicly what they are doing and learning?

I think the data community in general is very open and receptive, so if someone has something to share, they should just go ahead and do it. I&#8217;ve personally spent over a decade without really sharing anything outside of twitter comments, but that eventually led to writing articles and people finding those useful (to my surprise).

### Where do you see your own data career going next? Building on your technical skills as an Individual Contributor or moving into a more management-based role?

For now my goal is to move somewhat towards management. There&#8217;s always &#8220;bigger problems&#8221; that need more time and resources to analyze and make happen. Since I can&#8217;t do it alone I want to do it with the help of others.

### If you had a list of “best-kept-secrets” (websites, books, coaches), which would you recommend?

I think the big cluster of people interested in data on Twitter is the best thing ever. There&#8217;s always someone around sharing a cool finding, a new tool, or collectively bonding over the insanity that is time zones. Participating in that leads to many good things.

### What is the number one piece of advice you give to aspiring data scientists?

[Know your data!](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-science-foundations-know-your-data-really-really-know-it-a6bb97eb991c?source=friends_link&sk=42f1c02883e744df7dbb618373312244) =D

A close second is respect and leverage domain knowledge experts, which I need to write about&#8230; eventually.

### Where can readers find you online?

Probably easiest on **Twitter**: <https://twitter.com/randy_au>
