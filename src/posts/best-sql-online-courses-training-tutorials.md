## What is SQL?

SQL is **Structured Query Language**. It lets you communicate with relational databases: getting data out, putting data in, changing data, removing data. And much more.

## Do I really need to learn SQL to be a data analyst?

I don't make the following statement lightly: SQL is a superpower for data analysts. If you have any intention of making a successful career in data, your first action should be to learn the basics of SQL.

It will stand by you for the rest of your career in a way that many other tech skills will not. In the words of the famous footwear brand with the swoosh: Just Do It.

## Where do I begin learning SQL?

Start with the basics.

SQL is one of those deceptive masters in that it's pretty easy to learn enough to get you up and running but it can take a lifetime to fully conquer it's advanced intricacies. Don't let that discourage you though, getting started and hooked is the easy part.

I'm going to build up a list of the best online SQL courses, training, resources and tutorials. I'll keep adding to it over time so feel free to drop me a note (alan AT simpleanalytical DOT com) if your favourite resource is missing.
